## Introduction

The Book Recommendation System is designed to assist users in discovering books that match their interests and reading preferences. It employs clustering to categorize similar books and KNN to make recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Book Recommendation System:

### Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scipy

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Book_Recommendation_System.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
